We utilized two onion website datasets. One dataset, a publicly available set provided by Overdorf and others, was collected from the second version of onion websites. You can access the original dataset through [this link](https://example.com/original-dataset). We also offer our processed version of this dataset. The other dataset was collected by us from the third version of onion websites and has been processed into separate files, categorizing packet direction, TCP payload size, and packet arrival times.
