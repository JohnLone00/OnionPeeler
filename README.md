OnionPeeler: A Website Fingerprinting Attack Targeting Tor Onion Services

## Dataset
We utilized two onion website datasets. One dataset, a publicly available set provided by Overdorf et al., was collected from the second version of onion websites. You can access the original dataset through [this link](https://cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/fingerprintability/#data). We also offer our processed version of this dataset. The other dataset was collected by us from the third version of onion websites and has been processed into separate files, categorizing packet direction, TCP payload size, and packet arrival times. It can be accessed through the [this link](https://mega.nz/folder/3GZXhBhB#H41ZzuOFV5aX1krE4F0dgQ).
